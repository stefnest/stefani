    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>👋 Hello there! I'm Stefani Nestsiarovich, a passionate and aspiring web developer currently enrolled in the New Media Web Development program at BCIT. 🎓 My journey in the world of coding has been nothing short of exhilarating, and I'm on a mission to craft immersive and user-friendly digital experiences.</p>

<p>💻 Armed with skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I thrive on turning ideas into interactive and visually appealing websites. The art of coding is my canvas, and each project is an opportunity to create something extraordinary. 🚀</p>

<p>🎨 Beyond the lines of code, I also bring a keen understanding of UX/UI design to the table. I believe that a seamless and aesthetically pleasing design is the bridge between a user and a website, making the browsing experience not just functional but delightful.</p>

<p>🌐 As a BCIT student, I am constantly honing my skills and staying abreast of the latest industry trends. Whether it's troubleshooting a tricky bug or bringing a design concept to life, I embrace every challenge with enthusiasm and a commitment to excellence.</p>
